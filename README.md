# RobotControlAlgorithms
Various robot control algorithms for 3DoF manipulator: from Gravity Compensation to Force Control. Dynamical properties of the simulated robot are identical to the PUMA 560 surgical manipulator




Conventional control approach - Passivity Based Robust Control, tracks desired trajectory 
in the presence of parametric uncertainty:
